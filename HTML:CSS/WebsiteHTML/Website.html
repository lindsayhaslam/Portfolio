            <h1>About Me</h1>
           <p> My name is Lindsay and I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. I received my Bachelor's degree in English and am currently a graduate student studying software development at the University of Utah. (Seems random, I know!)</p>
            <p> I have a passion for creating and being innovative. Web design, mobile app development, and other types of software development are my outlets for creativity. I find fulfillment in developing products
            that are attractive and user-friendly.

        <p>I began to build mobile app games to get exposure to C# and iOS/Android development.
            So far, I've successfully deployed three games to the App Store and to Google Play, with a total of over 680 new-user downloads.
            I'm proud of this project because it demonstrates my grit and enthusiasm to be outside of my comfort zone.
            These mobile games were born from a desire to build a portfolio when I didn't have one.
            This experience taught me that the most important thing you can do when you want to learn something is to just get started!
            All artwork was created by me.
